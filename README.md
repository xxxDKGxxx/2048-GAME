## Simple 2048 Game
Written in C++ with winAPI library.

WASD moves the board.
Each move a new tile is added in a random spot with a number 2.
When two fields with matching numbers collide, a new field is created with a number that is the sum of the numbers of two tiles that have just collided.
The goal is to reach the tile with 2048 number (goal can be changed in the system menu).
